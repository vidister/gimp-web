If you want to discuss features, tips, tricks or contribute to the development of GIMP, then we have several useful mailing lists and [IRC channels](/irc.html) for you.

Please keep in mind that the mailing lists are not only _publicly available and archived_ for __anyone__ to read, but in some cases are also archived in places outside of our control.
Don't send any private or sensitive information!

## Code of Conduct

Mailing lists are an important communication channel between contributors and users of GIMP. Therefore we urge you to follow the following common etiquette rules. Failure to observe them, or instructions from the moderators, may be grounds for reprimand, probation, or removal.

*   **Be considerate and respectful**. Every email in our most popular mailing lists, gimp-user@ and gimp-developer@, will be read by ca. 1,000 subscribers and then aggregated to be seen by an even larger audience. Please make sure that you add value to the discussion, avoid repetitive arguments, flamewars, trolling, and personal attacks.
*   **Write in English**. While the GIMP community is multinational, we need a _lingua franca_ for communication which happens to be English. It's OK to have bad skills in English as long as you do your best.
*   **Do basic research**. Chances are that your questions, feature requests, or bug reports have already been thoroughly discussed, and decisions have already been made. See the list of source for reference below.
*   **Stick to plain text**. Please don't send emails in HTML.
*   **Be specific**. When describing a bug you discovered, please always mention: operating system and its version, architecture (32bit or 64bit), exact version of GIMP (use <tt>File->About</tt> for reference).
*   **Keep it short**. When replying long threads, please trim unnecessary content and write your replies inline instead of "top posting".

The code may change in the future, followed by a notification to subscribers.

Please use these sources to check for information on the project, roadmap, feature requests, bug reports etc.:

*   [Bug tracker](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=GIMP). Useful for checking bug reports and feature requests.
*   [Roadmap](http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap). We do not schedule releases, but we plan what things we work on next.
*   [FAQ](//www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html). There are some frequently asked questions we already replied.
*   [Usability](http://gui.gimp.org). There's ongoing work to improve user experience of GIMP.
*   [Development](http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Main_Page). If you wish to contribute, please check the wiki for basic information for developers.

We also suggest checking archives of the mailing lists for existing discussions.
