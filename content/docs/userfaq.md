## General questions

### Can I use GIMP commercially?

Yes, you can. GIMP is free software, it doesn't put restrictions on the kind
of work you produce with it.

### What's the GIMP's license, and how do I comply with it?

GIMP is distributed under terms of General Public License v3 and later. In a 
nutshell, this means:

* You are free to use GIMP, for any purpose
* You are free to distribute GIMP
* You can study how GIMP works and change it
* You can distribute changed versions of GIMP

Note that once you distribute modified version of GIMP, you also must publish 
your changes to the source code under GPLv3+ as well.

### Someone sold or tried to sell me GIMP on a 3rd party website. Is this legal?

Yes, under terms of the General Public License this is perfectly legal,
provided that the seller also gave you the source code of GIMP and any
modifications he/she introduced.

### Are you trying to develop a Photoshop killer app?

No. Most generic image editors look like Photoshop simply because Adobe's 
application was among the first image editors as we know them now, so 
developers tend to stick to what people know&nbsp;&mdash; in general terms.

What we aim to do is to create a high-end image manipulation application that 
is free to use and modify by everyone, ever.

Feature-wise, the proposed "high-end" status does automatically put GIMP into 
direct comparison against Photoshop, but we don't think about competition 
much. We have too many ideas of our own to implement, and too many things to 
improve before the notion of competition begins to make the slightest sense.

We do, however, acknowledge the fact that people will treat GIMP as Photoshop 
replacement no matter what we tell them, and that's all right with us. You 
own this software, it's up to you to decide how you make use of it.

### I don't like GIMP's user interface. Why can't you just copy Adobe Photoshop?

In the past, the development in the project was somewhat erratic with regards
to taking usability into consideration, which is rather typical for free
software projects, but inexcusable for a high-end image editor that GIMP aims to become.

Between 2006 and 2013, we worked with Peter Sikking of Man+Machine Works, a
professional usability architect, who helped us shape the project vision for
GIMP, interviews professional users to better understand their workflows and
demands, and wrote functional specifications for various GIMP features.

[This collaboration](http://gui.gimp.org) resulted in major improvements of 
GIMP's usability, in particular: the rectangular-based selection/cropping 
tools, the unified free/polyline selection tool, the single-window mode, the 
upcoming unified transformation tool etc.

While working on functional specifications, Peter researched how various
features are implemented in applications with a partially matching feature set
(such as Adobe Photoshop), but the final design was made to help actual users
complete their tasks as fast as possible. This is exactly the kind of approach
to designing interfaces that we consider to be superior to merely copying user
interaction decisions.

### I don't like the name GIMP. Will you change it?

No. We've discussed this numerous times, and we don't think this is really all
that necessary. We understand that some people feel offended by the colloquial
meaning of the name GIMP, but we cannot please everybody and should not
attempt to do so.

## Releases

### When do you release the next version of GIMP?

We release both updates to the current stable version and development versions. 

We cut new updates of the stable version in two cases: 1) some newly introduced 
bug is knowingly affecting a lot of users; 2) the amount of improvements and 
bug fixes is large enough to justify an update&nbsp;&mdash; typically, a few 
dozens of each, but there is no rule.

Currently we have no released unstable/development versions. We'd like to 
release GIMP 2.9.0 as the first step towards GIMP 2.10 sometime in 2015, but 
quite a few changes have to be made first.

### Why can't you announce dates of future releases?

We are a team of volunteers with day jobs, families, and personal interests
beyond development of software. Given that, we try to avoid the situation when
we cannot deliver a release, because something else at work/in family came up.

Instead we provide a [feature-based roadmap](http://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Roadmap) 
that roughly outlines, in what order we will be implementing various popular 
requests made by users.

### Aren't you interested in doing paid development of GIMP via crowdfunding?

We already have jobs we love. However we actively encourage personal
fundraisers by trusted contributors. If you are willing to launch a campaign
and develop some features for GIMP, talk to us about changes you are about to
propose. We'll help you to flesh out your idea and promote it to a larger
community.

## Features

### When will GIMP support HDR imaging and processing with 16bit per color channel precision?

GIMP 2.10 will be the first version to feature processing with precision of
16, 32, and 64bit per color channel. This version is currently in the works,
and this particular feature has already been implemented.

### When will GIMP support any kind of non-destructive editing like adjustment layers, layer filters, and/or full-blown node-based editing?

Currently the plan is to introduce non-destructive editing in GIMP 3.2. This
is a huge change that will require rethinking the workflow, designing a new 
file format for GIMP projects etc.

### Will GIMP open raw (.NEF, .CR2 etc.) files from my camera?

Currently you need to install [UFRaw](http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/) to open 
raw files. It's both a standalone application and a GIMP plug-in for opening 
and processing raw images.

Upcoming GIMP 2.10 is featuring a plug-in for using [darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) to process raw images on Linux. Additionally, users will be able to set a preferred raw processing application, when multiple GIMP plug-ins of that kind are available.

### I do a lot of desktop publishing related work. Will you ever support CMYK?

Better support for CMYK has been on our roadmap for a long time. However 
this project has certain prerequisites such as the complete port of GIMP to 
GEGL.

The idea, how we want to make this work, was introduced by user interaction 
architect Peter Sikking at Libre Graphics Meeting 2009 and later&nbsp;&mdash; 
in his two-part article in his company's blog: 
[1](http://blog.mmiworks.net/2009/05/gimp-enter.html), 
[2](http://blog.mmiworks.net/2009/06/gimp-squaring-cmyk-circle.html). Please 
take some time to read up on that.

It's worth mentioning that currently CMYK is considered by us a low-priority 
project. Here's why.

Things like non-destructive editing are required by pretty much all 
users&nbsp;&mdash; photographers, designers, desktop publishing engineers, 
and even scientists. At the same time, CMYK is required only by a small subset 
of our user base. We prioritize our work accordingly.

Note that should a new developer join the team to specifically work on 
CMYK-related features, we will do our best to help him/her to complete this 
project and get it to our users as soon as possible.

### I don't like some changes you introduced in recent GIMP versions. Why can't you add a checkbox to disable them?

We realize that some changes are disruptive to some groups of users,
especially those who got used to GIMP as an image editor for doing quick fixes
to lossy files such as JPEG, PNG etc. (i.e. files that cannot store layers,
masks, custom channels, paths).

However, adding a switch for every change we make adds numerous levels of
complexity that we'd rather avoid. Additionally, it would lead to dramatically
changing the way we mean GIMP to work. Hence we respectfully disagree to make
extra behaviour switches.

At the same time, if you don't wish to abandon GIMP completely, we recommend
having a look at the 
[Saver and Save/export clean plug-ins](http://www.shallowsky.com/software/gimp-save/) 
by Akkana Peck, as well as at various GIMP forks on GitHub, although typically 
they aren't maintained up to date with regards to bugfixes.

### Why doesn't GIMP use GTK+3?

We made a preliminary port of GIMP to GTK+3 a few years ago and intend to complete it once v2.10 is out. GTK+3 based GIMP will be eventually released as v3.0 (see the [roadmap](http://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Roadmap) for reference).

The reason we prioritize it that way is that users who don't make a heavy use of Wacom tablets on Windows can live with GTK+2 based GIMP another year or so. However not providing high bit depth precision for editing makes GIMP unusable in professional workflows involving color grading and retouching.

When completing the GTK+3 port, we will have to break API/ABI compatibility to make GIMP's custom widgets work with GTK+3. Moreover, we need to break a few more things to make GIMP's architecture cleaner and prepare it for non-destructive editing (a feature currently planned for v3.2).

## Tips

### How do I draw a straight line?

In any of the drawing tools (Pen, Pencil, etc.), click on one endpoint of the 
line. Then hold the shift key and click on the other endpoint.

### How do I draw a circle or square?

In the Rectangular or Elliptical selection tool, click in one corner of your 
square or circle, then press Shift while dragging toward the other corner. Or 
enable the checkbox for Fixed: Aspect Ratio in tool options and make sure the 
aspect ratio is set to 1:1 before starting your square or circular selection.

Once you have a selection, Edit->Stroke Selection... will draw a line the 
shape of the selection you just made.

For curved selections, like circles, stroking with the Paintbrush paint tool 
will usually give a smoother looking line. You can get an even smoother line 
by converting the selection to a path (Select->To Path), then using 
Edit->Stroke Path... instead of Stroke Selection...

## Troubleshooting

### My graphic tablet doesn't work on  Windows/Mac. Does GIMP support advanced input devices such as Wacom?

Yes, GIMP does support graphic tablets and maps pressure, stroke speed and
other events to its advanced brush engine properties. However, the version of
the user interface toolkit that  GIMP currently relies on (GTK+ 2.x) is broken
beyond repair on Windows and Mac with regards to supporting advanced input
devices such as Wacom's.

To fix this, we need to port GIMP to GTK+3 where everything works as expected.
Some work on that has already been done in the
[gtk3-port](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/log/?h=gtk3-port) Git branch.
However we won't have time to give this our full attention until GIMP 2.10 is
out. We encourage interested developers to either work on the GTK+3 port or,
better yet, help us finish GIMP 2.10.
