'''
This is a skeleton for testing the parsing of a MIRRORS file
to show a list on /downloads/
'''

'''
It's been created by me, Pat David, to do what I need for wgo.
This is based heavily on stuff the LoTR was doing already...
Don't try to make any sense of it.  I don't know what I'm doing.
I am not kidding.

'''
Update 2016-07-20
    Had to change the signal to
    `signals.content_written.connect(do_mirrors)`
    so we actualy catch the rendered .html files
    after they've been through the template.
    This way we can look for <!-- MIRRORS --> to
    replace it with the correct parsed list.
